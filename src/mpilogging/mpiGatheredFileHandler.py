class MPIGatheredFileHandler(MPIFileHandler):
    """
    A handler class which gathers formatted logging records from all MPI ranks
    and writes them to a disk file on a single rank.

        """Open the specified file and use it as the stream for logging.

        Warnings
        --------

        This `~logging.Handler` is prone to deadlocks if an event is not
        logged by all ranks, e.g., if it is made within a conditional that
        not all ranks branch into.  If this is a concern, consider using
        `~.mpiScatteredFileHandler.MPIScatteredFileHandler` instead.

        Parameters
        ----------
        filename : str
            The name of the file to open for logging.
        *args
            Arguments are as described in the docstring of
            `~logging.FileHandler`.
        write_rank : int
            MPI rank that actually writes to the file (default: 0).
        comm : MPI.Comm
            MPI communicator to gather log records over.
        **kwargs
            Keyword arguments are as described in the docstring of
            `~logging.FileHandler`.
